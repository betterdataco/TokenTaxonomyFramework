The encumbering party should make a request to encumber, the owner should be notified about the request, and accept the request, which will finalize the encumbrance and send the EncumberResponse message to the requestor.",
      "businessExample": "For example, a property title's owner may have obtained a loan from a bank to purchase the property. The loan represents a contract between the owner of the property and the bank, this loan encumbers the property title preventing the owner from being able to sell the property, transferable, to another party until the loan is paid off. Paying off the loan will remove the encumber, which will allow transferable to be invoked.",
