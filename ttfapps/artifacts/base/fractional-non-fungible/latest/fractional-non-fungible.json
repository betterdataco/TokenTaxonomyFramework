      "businessDescription": "Every non-fungible token is unique and some will need to allow for fractional ownership. A non-fungible token is not interchangeable with other tokens of the same class as they typically have different values.  A property title is a good example of a non-fungible token where the value of different real estate titles is not equal and freely exchanging them is a bad idea. Some Non-fungible tokens will need to be represented with their own class, meaning it will share no common properties with other tokens from the same template. Other non-fungible tokens can exist within the same class and have some shared property values while also having unique property values between instances.",
