1. Go to **./model** and run ``build-with-docker.sh`` there   
2. Then go under **./tools/TaxonomyService** and run ``docker-build.sh``   
It will run everything and you can go to port 8000 
3. Finally go to **./tools/TTF-Web-UI**
there, run ``yarn install`` then ``yarn start``   
Now you can go to port 3000 (webpack dev host)
